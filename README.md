# Developing

If you want to add a new user, before starting with the installation you will need few steps:

1. [new maintainers only] Ask a maintainer for the AWS keys and credentials so you can interact with local amplify cli and access AWS console respectively
2. Add the user gmail account to the google console as a test user (for now)


## Installation

Run `nvm use` to set the correct node version.

```
yarn                  # Install frontend dependencies
yarn stocker:install  # Install backend dependencies
```

If not installed yet, install amplify cli with `npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli`. Then if it's your first time, you'll have to pull the amplify project:

> Make sure to select your AWS profile credentials with `export AWS_PROFILE=maffin`

```
10:56 $ amplify pull
